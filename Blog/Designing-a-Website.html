        <p>Us web designers… we like to jump right into the creative ball pit sometimes, and get right to the fun stuff in Photoshop & CSS. I know I’m guilty of it sometimes, and I bet you have been too in the past.</p>

          <p>It’s not the end of the world, but it really isn’t best practice for design – and if you’re a professional, you should be paying attention and adhering to best practices. That’s why there are a few steps you should take before designing a website...</p>

          <h2 id="meet-the-clients">Meet The Client</h2>

          <p>I’m a big proponent of meeting the client face-to-face at least once prior to beginning a project, when possible. There’s no better way to build trust with someone and figure out whether the two of you are a good match for a project than a face-to-face meeting. Here, you can make some small talk, learn about their business and goals, tell them about yours and more.</p>

          <p>I understand that, in today’s day and age, not all of your clients are necessarily in your city or otherwise available to meet face-to-face. In this instance, a video chat application like Skype is a great answer.</p>

          <p>Anyway, building trust with one another lays the groundwork for the best project possible. It’s established in this meeting how much you know about your field, and how much the client knows about theirs. If neither feels comfortable about the other, then one can decline the project early on and avoid potential headaches down the road.</p>

          <h2 id="site-requirements">Site Requirements</h2>

          <p>The site requirements is a vital step in the beginning stages of a website design project. It identifies user groups, their needs, and the company’s goals and adapts this information to a requirement list for the site. It provides a logical backbone to design off of and will allow you, down the road, to design to meet those outlined goals and requirements.</p>

          <p>Some designers have clients fill out an online form or a questionnaire of some sort, on their own time, to gather this information. While this will save you time, I prefer to gather this information through an informal face-to-face meeting. The reason for this? Defining a list of users, the methods in which they’ll find the site, the options you want to present to them etc. are all very industry-specific skills. It’s entirely possible your client – say, a family-run for example – will have no idea how to accurately answer these questions.</p>

          <p>I think it’s the responsibility of the web designer to help the client outline these needs and users – not just to fire a list of questions to them and leave the client to their own devices. My knowledge in the field means I can ask a series of pointed questions and give related examples to help drill down to the real information I need to do my jobs.</p>

          <p>Over time, you’ll develop your own list of questions to complete a needs assessment, but here are some to get you started:</p>

          <p><b>Who are the potential users of this site?</b></p>
          <p><b>How will the users arrive(browser, referral, SEO) at the site?</b></p>
          <p><b>What platforms will the users be using the site on?</b></p>
          <p><b>Are there specific functions required? </b>(E-commerce, blogging, subscription, etc)</p>
          <p><b>What does the site need to accomplish (for each/every user group)? </b></p>

          <p>Leverage their business goals with your design knowledge in order to maximize the project’s potential.</p>

          <h2 id="proposal">Proposal</h2>

          <p>The site requirements list allows you to go off and write up a proposal for your client. This proposal is a document that outlines all the information required for the project. Our proposals include the following sections:</p>
          
          <p><b>Client Name</b></p>
          <p><b>Client Needs</b> outlining what was described in the site requirements</p>
          <p><b>Recommended Solution</b></p>
          <p><b>Project Phases</b> Suggested phases: Site Requirements, Content/ Research/ Wireframing, Design, Development, Testing, Launch & Training)</p>
          <p><b>Fee Summary</b> Unless you are working for free</p>

          <p>Your proposals may be more succinct or more in-depth – it’s your business, and your clients, so you make the call. Just make sure it’s digestible, legible, logical, and that it looks sharp. </p>

          <p>We then carried that layout idea through to the institutional landing page before diverging the layout to fit the needs of the content deeper in the site.</p>
          
          <h2 id="sign-the-contract-&-take-payment">Sign The Contract & Take Payment</h2>

          <p>Once the client gives you the verbal acceptance of your proposal – which they will, because you’ve taken such good care of them and shown so much interest, right? – you need to draft up a contract. No need to re-invent the wheel – <a name="https://speckyboy.com/5-free-to-use-freelance-design-contract-templates/">here’s a list of some web design contract templates</a> to get you started.</p>

          <p>Part of your contract should state the fee payment schedule. I either take 50% up front, or do a 25/25/50 split depending on the contract – I highly recommend doing something similar, depending on the project size/your history with the client etc. A financial commitment to the project is a good commitment to make, and will help both parties feel at ease that the project is being handled professionally.</p>

          <p>Once you’ve completed all the above steps, you’re ready to enter into the design stage. Now, I don’t mean you should immediately open up Photoshop and start going buck wild with the gradient tool or anything – I start with research & wireframing.</p>
